Simple Django app to manage bookmarks

Brief overview of structure
~/ - displays main page
~/bookmarks/ - displays main page
~/bookmarks/user/"USERNAME" - displays bookmarks belonging to a user
	If user is logged in, user can edit
~/bookmarks/user - search your bookmarks if logged in
A nav bar should be available in the top right with links to home, login, register, logout (if logged in), and USERNAME's bookmarks (if logged in)

Running Test server
run 'python manage.py runserver'
Server at http://127.0.0.1:8000/
admin login: admin
admin password: admin
You should be able to follow links around.
Register to create a user or sign in as admin.
Click on your username in the nav bar to manage bookmarks.

Run Test cases
run 'python manage.py test'


TODO:
-Move all views to class based views
-Add more test cases

BUGS:
-editting an existing url creates a new bookmarks and leaves the old bookmark
